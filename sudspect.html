                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Sudspect is a mobile app that supports scanning for fast access to ingredient information on common home cleaning products; presenting a rating for each product scanned</p>

                        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                        <p>Consumers struggle to make eco-conscious laundry choices due to greenwashing and a lack of transparency, leading to microplastic pollution that harms ecosystems and human health. Without accessible, reliable information, identifying truly sustainable products remains a challenge.
                        </p>

                        <h2>User Research</h2>
                        <p><strong>Target Audience: </strong>Parents and caregivers who are concerned about harmful chemicals in laundry detergent</p>

                        <p>Eco conscious consumers looking for genuinely sustainable products, not the mainstream greenwashing</p>
                            
                        <p>Low-income consumers looking for affordable and non-toxic alternatives</p>
                            
                        <p>People with sensitive skin or allergies in need of synthetic-free products</p>

                        <p><strong>Objectives: </strong>The goal is to increase transparency, make sustainable shopping easy and affordable, drive awareness of microplastics, and hold brands accountable using a brand sustainability tracker to expose misleading or greenwashed claims.</p>
                        <p>To be accomplished through barcode scanners.</p>
                        <p>Brand transparency tracker </p>
                        <p>Personalized recommendations based on budget and needs</p>
                        <p>Easy-to-digest educational facts about sustainability in products</p>
                        <p>Clear visual hierarchy with icons and color-coded ratings, fast UI</p>

                        <h2>Surveys</h2>
                        <p><strong>60% </strong>moderately value sustainability in laundry products</p>
                        <p><strong>40% </strong>reported not being very aware of environmental impacts in laundry products</p>
                        <p><strong>80% </strong>of consumers are unsure which products are truly sustainable</p>


                       <h3>Synthesis</h3>
                       <p><strong>User Persona</strong></p>
                       <p>Meet Stephen, a low-income single dad, is busy and needs a fast and efficient solution to identify sustainable laundry options to best protect his children from harmful chemicals, but also an efficient product to sanitize and remove stains from their clothes.</p>

                       <p><strong>Pain Points</strong></p>
                       <p>Consumers struggle finding budget friendly options that are sustainable and clean</p>
                       <p>Consumers find it difficult to know which options are genuinely sustainable</p>

                       <p><strong>Competitve Analysis</strong></p>
                       <p><img src="images/comp-anal-suds.png"></p>
                       <p>All three of these apps include a simple display breakdown of ingredients, the potential harm, and are visually appealing. The most common gaps are the lack of in-app purchasing. A user can scan a product, but has to go to a different browser or app to complete a purchase. Additionally, only Codecheck had user reviews on products displayed - this is an important feature to build trust and gain community insights. Lastly, all of the apps covered a wide range of products, often meaning it was difficult to see laundry products right away and filter by skin type, microplastics, chemicals, and more without being convoluted with other categories.</p>

                       <p>My first round of user testing provided clarity on what my next steps were. I organized and categorized the most common pain points for my three flows.</p>

                       <p><strong>Mid-Fidelity</strong></p>

                       <p><img src="images/use-test-to.png" width="500"></p>
                       <p>My second round of user testing provided more interactive feedback due to the mid-fidelity offering user touch points. I again organized my second phase of user testing into the three main categories, identifying the most common issues my users experienced.</p>
